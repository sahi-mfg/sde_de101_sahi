# What does a Data Engineer do ?

From a laymanâ€™s understanding of the definition of data engineering, it sounds like the engineer in charge of data.

Data engineering is a science that pays more attention to designing, collecting, processing, analysing, and building data. Most times, the data in question is LARGE and SCALABLE. The process of engineering the data helps to maintain and scale both structured and unstructured data, allowing other parts of the business to use that data to make decisions and deliver products.

## The data engineering life cycle

1. **Data Collection**: This is the first step in the data engineering life cycle. Data is collected from various sources, such as databases, APIs, logs, and more. The data is then stored in a data warehouse or data lake.

2. **Data Storing**: The data is stored in a data warehouse or data lake. Data warehouses are used to store structured data, while data lakes are used to store unstructured data.

3. **Data Processing**: The data is processed to make it usable. This includes cleaning the data, transforming the data, and loading the data into a data warehouse or data lake.

4. **Data Analysis**: The data is analyzed to gain insights. This includes running queries on the data, building reports, and creating visualizations.

5. **Data Modelling**: The data is modeled to make it easier to work with. This includes creating data models, building data pipelines, and creating data sets.

## A data engineering case study

You're tasked with building a data pipeline for POS data from a store like Carrefour. This data will be used by data scientists. How do you do it ?

With a case study question, the first step is to ask clarifying questions. You should gather as much information as you need. Then, propose a solution.

TIPS for tackling a data engineering case study

- **Problem-solving approach**: When presented with a problem, interviewers want to know the steps you will take to solve it.

- **Thoroughness**: Before you jump into an answer, get clarification. You should understand exactly what they're looking for before giving an answer.

- **Ability to communicate**: Think out loud and walk the interviewer through the process. Say exactly why you would make a particular choice.

- **Design patterns**: With architecture problems, you should have a strong grasp of design patterns, as well as the technos and products that can be used to solve the problem.

- **Forward thinking**: Every data engineering solution includes trade-offs. Interviewers want to see that you can assess a solution in terms of pros and cons, as well as potential weaknesses of a solution.

## Who is fit for a data engineering role?

A Data Engineer must have a programming background. Technical skills needed include a proficiency in SQL, Python, R, and ETL approaches and practices. Additionally, you should have an interest in the heirarchy and structure of information, and a willingness to grapple with tough problems. Building and managing such a complex frameworks and information pipelines requires someone with determination and creativity as well as critical thinking, technical skills, and the ability to think and work independently.

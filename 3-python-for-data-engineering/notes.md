# Python for data engineering

Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used in data engineering. It is a high-level language that is easy to learn and use, and it has a large number of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to work with data.

In this section, we will cover some of the key concepts and libraries that you need to know to work with data in Python.

## Key concepts

### Data types

Python has several built-in data types that you can use to work with data. Some of the most common data types include:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc.
- **Floats**: Numbers with decimal points, such as 1.0, 2.5, 3.14, etc.
- **Strings**: Text data, such as "hello", "world", etc.
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, such as [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"], etc.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, such as {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"city": "New York", "population": 8000000}, etc.

### Control flow

Python has several control flow statements that you can use to control the flow of your program. Some of the most common control flow statements include:

- **If statements**: Used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
- **For loops**: Used to iterate over a sequence of items.
- **While loops**: Used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **Break and continue statements**: Used to control the flow of a loop.
- **Try and except statements**: Used to handle exceptions in your code.

### Functions

Functions are blocks of code that you can reuse in your program. They take input, perform some operations, and return output. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword. For example:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

### Libraries

- **Seaborn**: A plotting library that provides functions to create statistical plots and charts.
- **Plotly**: A plotting library that provides functions to create interactive plots and charts.
- **Folium**: A mapping library that provides functions to create interactive maps.
- **Geopandas**: A library for working with geospatial data that provides tools for working with geographic data.

## Key libraries

### Pandas

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that provides data structures and functions to work with structured data. Some of the key features of Pandas include:

- **Data structures**: Pandas provides two main data structures: Series and DataFrame. Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, while DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that can hold multiple data types.
- **Data manipulation**: Pandas provides functions to manipulate data, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data.
- **Data cleaning**: Pandas provides functions to clean data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data.
- **Data visualization**: Pandas provides functions to visualize data, such as creating plots and charts.
- **Data input/output**: Pandas provides functions to read and write data from and to various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON.
- **Data merging**: Pandas provides functions to merge data from multiple sources, such as joining, concatenating, and merging data.
- **Data reshaping**: Pandas provides functions to reshape data, such as pivoting, stacking, and melting data.
- **Data analysis**: Pandas provides functions to analyze data, such as calculating statistics, performing time series analysis, and working with categorical data.
- **Data transformation**: Pandas provides functions to transform data, such as applying functions, encoding data, and scaling data.
- **Data modeling**: Pandas provides functions to model data, such as building machine learning models, performing feature engineering, and evaluating models.

### Polars

Polars is a fast and efficient data manipulation library that provides data structures and functions to work with large datasets. Some of the key features of Polars include:

- **Data structures**: Polars provides two main data structures: Series and DataFrame. Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, while DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that can hold multiple data types.
